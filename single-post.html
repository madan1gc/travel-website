                            Kilimanjaro and Everest Base Camp are two of the world's most famous and challenging
                            high-altitude treks. But they're very different from one another. We discuss these
                            differences and argue that Kilimanjaro is the harder trek overall.

                        A common question among trekkers and would-be trekkers is if Kilimanjaro is harder than Everest
                        Base
                        Camp?

                        The answer, as you might suspect, is not clear cut.

                        While we feel that at the end of the day Kilimanjaro is the harder of the two treks, there are a
                        couple of reasons for arguing that Everest Base Camp is in fact harder. So we lay before you the
                        reasons for arguing that each is harder to help you decide for yourself.

                        Summit night on Kilimanjaro is a real test of mettle. Having had only a handful of hours of
                        sleep
                        (or nervous rest), you must leave your warm sleeping bag and prepare for a night-time ascent.

                        around midnight, you head out into the cold and dark to make a go for the summit, known as Uhuru
